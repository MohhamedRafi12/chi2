    "1) Make a histogram of your random distribution.  Verify that the the numbers you generated agree with the shape of the function.  Generate at least 5000 points and plot your data histogram with errorbars.  You can use numpy+matplotlib+etc or pyROOT or a mix.  Think about how to appropriately normalize your function to overlay it with the data.  The normalization depends on the number of bins, the bin range and the number of points thrown.  You may find it easier to first nromalize the area of your function to 1.0, thus turning it into a proper PDF.  "
